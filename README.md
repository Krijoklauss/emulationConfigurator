# What is this?
This program is a easy to use emulator website hosted locally on your computer.
After installing you can pick the games you want to play and apply some filters or do other emulation configurations
on the website. After clicking on the play button your game will be launched in the fitting emulator. You can make different configurations for each game so the emulator settings always fit your computer.
All this is basically for people who do not want to waste time configuring emulators. This makes Emulator usage way more accessable for all kinds of people.

# Installation

- Download the code as a zip and unpack it in C:\
- After you've done that download PHP from https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip and extract its content into -> C:\emulationConfigurator\PHP\
- All the games you want to start have to be placed under C:\emulationConfigurator\games\CONSOLE

# Run
- After the installation just run the 'Run' shortcut (You can place it wherever you want, Desktop for example)

# Coming soon
- In the future we will remove all the emulators as well and provide download links to all of them
- You'll have to install/copy all the emulators to the correct paths (C:\emulationConfigurator\emulator\EMULATOR_NAME)
but we will provide a README.md file for each of them, to make the installation easier for people who do not know what they're doing exactly.
- Currently this only supports windows, but Linux systems will be supported soon aswell
